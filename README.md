**3. Extract & Use**


It is not mandatory to use Node & Gulp as mentioned below for using this admin template, We have used Node & Gulp to compile SCSS file to CSS and generate minified dist CSS & JS file only. You can use direct CSS and JS files to customize and use this admin template. You can use this admin template any JS framework like Angular, React & Vue and integrate with any back-end technology like PHP, Ruby, .Net, Java & Python etc...

### Gulp

NodeJS is required be installed on your system to run node commands. You can download and install nodejs from this URL: https://nodejs.org/en/

**[GulpJS](http://gulpjs.com/)** is a JavaScipt task runner. In one word: automation. The less work you have to do when performing repetitive tasks like minification, compilation, unit testing, linting, etc...

- Install gulp globally with ``` npm install gulp-cli -g```
- To install node packages, navigate to the template root directory, make sure to rename default package.json file to package.grunt.json and rename package.gulp.json file to package.json file. Then ``` run npm install ```. NPM use the package.json file and automatically install the required local dependencies listed in it.

```
npm install
```
